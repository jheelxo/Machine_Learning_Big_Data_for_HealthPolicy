For my "Machine Learning Applied to Economic Policy Analysis" class during the 2nd year of my Masters in Dauphine - PSL, my classmate and I webscrapped data on covid related search words between May 2020 and May 2022
to create a link between google search trends and the incidence rate of COVID-19 first at the department level, and further aggregated at a national level in France. 

The main goal of the project was to understand the link between people's google search queries and possibilities of them testing positive for COVID-19 with a 1-week lag. The results can be used for harnessing Big Data
for health policy formulation and evaluation.
